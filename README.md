This is my first solo project after completing the last project towards my code institute full stack software development diploma.
I have decided to build A simple game based on the much loved retro NES game "Duck Hunt". I am building this game using only HTML5 and CSS3.

### Images

- The Gameplay Background, The fly duck and the dead duck images were created with DALL-E from prompts enginered by myself.
- The Target Mouse cursor was supplied by [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/browse/icons/term/target-cursor/).
- All images were resized with GIMP.
- Both duck images backgrounds were removed using [Retoucher](https://retoucher.online/)
